# LAMarathon2022-Data-Analysis
As part of my coursework at UCLA Anderson, I developed data scraping skills using Selenium and applied them to collect and analyze data from the LA Marathon 2022 website. 

Using Tableau, I created a comprehensive dashboard that included visualizations of runner demographics, pace analysis, and performance over time. 

This project not only improved my data analysis and visualization skills but also provided valuable insights into the LA Marathon and the running community.
